# CS2
This is the official implementation of our proposed CS2 accepted by MICCAI 2022:

CS2: A Controllable and Simultaneous Synthesizer of Images and Annotations with Minimal Human Intervention

![](./figs/fig1.png)



## Highlight
The novelty of our work is three-fold: 
- we develop a novel unsupervised mask-to-image synthesis pipeline that generates images controllably without human labeling; 
- instead of directly using the numeric and disarranged unsupervised segmentation masks, which are cluttered with over-segmented super-pixels, we assign the mean Hounsfield unit(HU) value for each cluster in the unsupervised segmentation masks to obtain anordered and well-organized labeling; 
- we propose a new synthesis network structure featured by multiple adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) blocks that handles unaligned structural and tissue information.
